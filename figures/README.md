## How to reproduce the figures?  
Run the `plots.ipynb` notebook and make sure that that the directories where the nlcd and cit files are present is correct. Also change the path where you want the output files to be saved.  
For the muscle tissue figures, once the final list of cis-trans and trans-cis (both converted from ensembl to gene names) are obtained, cytoscape is used to plot the figures.  
`cit_plot_git.r` plots the $L=0$ and $L=1$ difference in predictions figure.
