## How to reproduce the data generated?
Open the `data_generate_final.ipynb` file and run the functions, there is a section to reproduce all the generated data. Make sure to give the output directory different from the existing directory, else the data will be replaced by the newly generated data. 

## Data Naming Convention: 
'Indp' -> Independent dataset \
'Sine' -> Sine dataset \
'Linear' -> Linear dataset \
'Saw' -> Sawtooth dataset \
'Para' -> Parabola dataset \
'Paravar' -> Parabola with unequal variance dataset \
The number in the file name indicates the number of samples in each trio.
Each file contains trios generated with varying values of coefficients. (Refer the notebook)
